# Project Overview
This repository contains two main components:

1. University Lab Report (PDF): A lab report detailing the measurement of the lifetime of muons, conducted as part of a university project.

2. Python Script (detector_area.py): A Python script used to calculate the effective area of the muon detector, based on data from a Monte Carlo simulation, which was previously discussed.

These files together demonstrate both theoretical analysis and practical implementation related to muon detection and measurement.
